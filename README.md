 Check these links out, and Note, this is not the guide I promised, I got 
sidetracked with other projects and this as well. But it's coming, maybe
 next week, we shall see. Bookmark this blog, and stay tuned to more. 
And of course like, comment and share, if you have anything to add 
comment down below, and I will add it.

Aside from that I have to 
give credit where credit is due, this is not fully my work, I only 
modified it, added a few things and styled it. I got this from GitHub. 
It was forked by Triclorne (Bright Gameli) and I believe the author is https://github.com/Trietptm-on-Security/simple-opsec. So if you want the original go to https://github.com/triclorne/simple-opsec Since the author's page is missing. For those who want to follow me in GitHub: https://github.com/4julu. You all have a wonderful days, stay sharp and talk geeky to me anytime.
